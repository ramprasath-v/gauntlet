# Nebius / NVIDIA Build Diary

## Entry

Date: 2026-09-27
Milestone: M1 — Exploit Confirmed

Nebius product used: Not used yet.
NVIDIA model used: Not used yet.

What we attempted:
Created an async model protocol, a deterministic vulnerable simulator, a Nebius adapter boundary, and environment-only future configuration. No live provider call was attempted.

Zero-to-hello-world onboarding:
- steps: not attempted for Nebius
- approximate time: not measured
- documentation used: no Nebius documentation evaluated in M1

What worked well:
Not used yet; no provider observations.

Specific friction / bugs:
Not evaluated.

Errors encountered:
No provider requests were made.

Latency:
Not measured.

Reliability:
Not measured.

Cost/token observations:
Not measured; no live model calls were made.

What would improve the product:
No evidence-based provider feedback yet.

Would we build with it again?
Why / why not?
Not evaluated. Intended Nemotron use through Nebius Token Factory: attack planning, actionable failure-path analysis, patch generation, regression-test generation, and attack mutation. Final verdicts remain deterministic application decisions based on execution evidence.

- approximate time: not measured
- documentation used: none for Nebius in M2

What worked well: No provider observations.
Specific friction / bugs: Not evaluated.
Errors encountered: No provider requests.
Latency: Not measured.
Reliability: Not measured.
Cost/token observations: Not measured.
What would improve the product: No evidence-based provider feedback yet.
Would we build with it again? Why / why not? Not evaluated yet.

Milestone: M3.1 — Provider-Backed AI Remediation

Nebius product used: Token Factory API integration implemented; live service not called.
NVIDIA model selected: `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`.

What we attempted: Implemented the documented OpenAI-compatible
`/v1/chat/completions` boundary with Bearer authentication and JSON-schema
structured output. The provider receives only M2 evidence plus the bounded,
hashed authorized source symbol and returns a strict `RepairProposal`.

Why this model: Nebius's official model cookbook lists Nemotron 3 Super as an
available NVIDIA reasoning/instruction-following model with structured-output
support. Its model identifier and the us-central1 Token Factory base URL are
recorded in `.env.example` rather than inferred at runtime.

Zero-to-hello-world onboarding:
- setup: export `NEBIUS_API_KEY`, `NEBIUS_BASE_URL`, and `NEBIUS_MODEL`, then run `python -m gauntlet.cli nebius-repair-smoke`
- authentication: Bearer token from `NEBIUS_API_KEY`; secrets are never logged or committed
- API compatibility: OpenAI-compatible chat-completions request implemented directly with existing `httpx`
- structured output: request uses `response_format.type=json_schema` with the Pydantic-generated `RepairProposal` schema
- documentation used: Nebius Token Factory structured-output documentation and the official Nebius Token Factory cookbook page for Nemotron 3 Super
- approximate live onboarding time: not measured

What worked well: A mock transport verified the final URL, Bearer header, exact
model ID, and structured-output request. The deterministic provider exercised
the entire evidence-to-proposal flow, and its diff passed `git apply --check`.

Specific friction / bugs: An initial relative URL began with `/`, which would
have discarded `/v1` under standard base-URL resolution; the final transport
uses a trailing-slash base and relative `chat/completions`. The initial offline
fixture diff lacked enough context for `git apply`; contextual hunks fixed it.

Errors encountered: No provider response errors because no live request was made.
Latency: Not measured.
Reliability: Live reliability not evaluated; mocked request-contract and offline flow tests pass.
Cost/token observations: Not measured; no paid request was made.
Live request made: No. `NEBIUS_API_KEY`, `NEBIUS_BASE_URL`, and `NEBIUS_MODEL` were unset. `LIVE_PROVIDER_NOT_TESTED`.

What would improve the product: A documented non-billable validation endpoint
or schema-only request mode would allow credential and model-access checks
without a generation charge. Live error and latency observations require a
configured account.

Would we build with it again? The integration contract is straightforward and
testable, but no conclusion about live service behavior is justified until the
explicit smoke command runs with credentials.

Milestone: M3 — Evidence-Guided Patch + Re-Attack

Nebius product used: Not used yet.
NVIDIA model used: Not used yet.

What we attempted: Consumed serialized M2 evidence to plan one constrained
local repair, re-ran the same exploit, checked legitimate behavior, and linked
the results in a deterministic proof artifact. No provider request was made.

Zero-to-hello-world onboarding:
- steps: not attempted
- approximate time: not measured
- documentation used: none for Nebius in M3

What worked well: No provider observations.
Specific friction / bugs: Not evaluated.
Errors encountered: No provider requests.
Latency: Not measured.
Reliability: Not measured.
Cost/token observations: Not measured.
What would improve the product: No evidence-based provider feedback yet.
Would we build with it again? Why / why not? Not evaluated yet.

Milestone: M4 — Isolated Sandbox Repair Loop

Nebius product used: Not used yet.
NVIDIA model used: Not used yet.

What we attempted: Applied the existing M3 plan to disposable local project
copies, ran fixed build/test commands, captured structured failures, exercised
a three-attempt bound, and verified cleanup plus an unchanged source digest.
A deterministic repair-proposal client exercised the future provider boundary.
No provider request was made.

Zero-to-hello-world onboarding:
- steps: not attempted
- approximate time: not measured
- documentation used: none for Nebius in M4

What worked well: No provider observations.
Specific friction / bugs: Not evaluated.
Errors encountered: No provider requests.
Latency: Not measured.
Reliability: Not measured.
Cost/token observations: Not measured.
What would improve the product: No evidence-based provider feedback yet.
Would we build with it again? Why / why not? Not evaluated yet.
